1. Compare 'hw.bin' with 'eg.bin'. Do the outputs match? (They don't necessarily have too).
     Yes, they are equal

2. Disassemble 'hw.bin' and compare the result with 'hw.S'. Does the output (at least approximately) matches 'hw.S'?

3. Boot 'hw.bin' using the 'qemu' emulator. Does it work?
     Yes, it's running and has the expected answer (prints "Hello World)
